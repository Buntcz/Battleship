# Battleship
Making a battleship game using JavScript and Unit Testing.

1. Make folders for all different things you will use, tests, assests(CSS) the main js script and html file will be just in the src, objects and game logic for each object.
2. Create a gameboard object with its coresponding methods and test them, do that for every next object you will create etc. Players, the computer player, the ships etc.
3. Combine everything together and make it work of course.

The thing we need to use here are tests so we can get familiar with them and I will not be using any of the instructions that Project Odin has provided.
